Following is the structure of the provided DoclingDocument JSON schema version 1.3.0. This description follows the hierarchy of the JSON.

**Root Object:**

The JSON document itself is a single root object `{}`. It contains several top-level keys that describe the document's metadata, structure, and content.

1.  **`schema_name` (String):** Identifies the type of schema being used.
    *   Example: `"DoclingDocument"`

2.  **`version` (String):** Specifies the version number of the schema.
    *   Example: `"1.3.0"`

3.  **`name` (String):** A user-defined or generated name for this specific document instance.
    *   Example: `"SBW_AI sample page10-11"`

4.  **`origin` (Object):** Contains metadata about the original source file from which this JSON was generated.
    *   `mimetype` (String): The MIME type of the source file (e.g., `"application/pdf"`).
    *   `binary_hash` (Number): A hash value representing the binary content of the source file.
    *   `filename` (String): The original filename of the source document.

5.  **`furniture` (Object):** Represents the root node for elements considered "furniture" â€“ content typically not part of the main document flow, like headers, footers, or page numbers.
    *   `self_ref` (String): A JSON Pointer reference to this object itself (e.g., `#/furniture`).
    *   `children` (Array): An array, often empty at this level. Furniture items are usually listed directly under `body` but identified by their `content_layer`.
    *   `content_layer` (String): Indicates the layer ("furniture").
    *   `name` (String): Name of the node (e.g., `_root_`).
    *   `label` (String): Semantic label (e.g., `unspecified`).

6.  **`body` (Object):** Represents the root node for the main content of the document.
    *   `self_ref` (String): A JSON Pointer reference to this object itself (e.g., `#/body`).
    *   `children` (Array): **Crucially**, this array defines the *ordered sequence* of the document's content elements. Each item in the array is an object containing a `$ref` key, which holds a JSON Pointer string referencing a specific element within the `texts`, `tables`, `pictures`, or `groups` arrays.
    *   `content_layer` (String): Indicates the layer ("body").
    *   `name` (String): Name of the node (e.g., `_root_`).

        *   `children` (Array): Usually empty for basic text blocks.
        *   `content_layer` (String): The layer this text belongs to ("body" or "furniture").
        *   `label` (String): **Important semantic classification** of the text block (e.g., `"text"`, `"section_header"`, `"list_item"`, `"page_header"`, `"page_footer"`).
        *   `prov` (Array): Provenance information. An array containing one or more objects detailing where this text block was found in the source document. Each provenance object contains:
            *   `page_no` (Number): The page number (1-based).
            *   `bbox` (Object): The bounding box coordinates (`l`, `t`, `r`, `b`) of the text on the page. Note the `coord_origin` (e.g., `"BOTTOMLEFT"`) indicating the coordinate system's origin.

        *   `page_no` (Number): The page number (integer).

**Hierarchy Summary:**

*   The root contains metadata (`schema_name`, `version`, `name`, `origin`), structural roots (`furniture`, `body`), content arrays (`groups`, `texts`, `pictures`, `tables`, `key_value_items`, `form_items`), and page descriptions (`pages`).
*   The `body.children` array dictates the flow/order of content by referencing items in the content arrays.
*   `groups`, `texts`, `pictures`, and `tables` store the actual content elements, each with provenance (`prov`) linking back to the source page and location.
*   Labels (`label`) within content elements provide semantic meaning (header, footer, list item, paragraph, etc.).
*   Tables have a nested `data` structure containing `table_cells` and a `grid` representation.
*   References (`$ref`) are used extensively to link related parts (parent-child, group items, body sequence).

This structure allows for representing both the sequential flow and the semantic classification of document elements, along with their source location and associated data (like images or table cells).
