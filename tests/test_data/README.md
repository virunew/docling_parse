# Test Data Directory

This directory contains test data files used by the integration tests. The tests are designed to automatically skip if the required test files are not present.

## Required Test Files

To run the full suite of integration tests, place the following files in this directory:

- `sample.pdf`: A sample PDF document for testing PDF processing
  
## Obtaining Test Files

You can create your own test files or use publicly available PDFs. For example:

1. Create a simple PDF file using tools like Word, Google Docs, or LaTeX
2. Download a public domain PDF from sources like Project Gutenberg
3. Use synthetic test files generated by PDF creation libraries

## Test Data Privacy

**IMPORTANT**: Do not commit any proprietary or confidential documents to this directory.
All test files should be either:

- Publicly available with appropriate licenses
- Synthetic test files created specifically for testing
- Simple example files with no confidential information

## Running Tests Without Test Data

If you don't have test data files available, the integration tests will automatically skip the tests that require those files. You'll see output like:

```
Skipped: Test PDF file not found: test_data/sample.pdf
```

You'll still be able to run the unit tests that don't require actual PDF files.
